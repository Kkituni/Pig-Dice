    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <p>On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die. However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited.
      Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just the total earned during that particular roll. A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn.
      If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.</p>
